<h2>What is a CTF?</h2>

CTF stands for 'Capture the flag'. CTF is a wargame where teams compete against each other by solving challenges and submit flags to earn points.
<br><br>
There are mainly two types of CTFs:
<br><br>

<h4>Jeopardy</h4>
Jeopardy-style CTFs are wargames that have a set of challenges in different categories of cyber security. The challenges are awarded points based on the difficulty, and a scoreboard in maintained to rank all the teams that are actively participating.
<br><br>
<h4>Attack-Defence</h4>
In this format, each team is given a machine (or small network) to defend on an isolated network. They can connect their networks to game network through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Teams score based both on their success in defending their assigned machine and their success in attacking other team’s machines. Each team needs to exploit the custom application services running at each team’s side. A team gains points by submitting the flags of other teams.

<br><br>

<h4>What is a FLAG?</h4>
Flag is a string of random data or text in some format. For example,
<code>bi0s{_Y0u_g0t_th3_fl4g_}</code><br>
Solving the challenge =  getting the hidden flag in the challenge.

<br><br>

<li><h4>Reverse Engineering</h4></li>
Process of cracking binaries one bit at a time to reveal its hidden secrets.
<br><br>

<li><h4>Web Exploitation</h4></li>
Finding bugs in web applications and exploiting it to steal access.
<br><br>

<li><h4>Cryptography</h4></li>
Deciphering highly encrypted messages by cracking complex algorithms.
<br><br>

<li><h4>Hardware</h4></li>
Breaking and making electronics, perhaps anything with solder in it.
<br><br>

<li><h4>Forensics</h4></li>
Unravelling the mysteries of the footprints left behind by the attacks.
<br><br>

<li><h4>Android Exploitation</h4></li>
Unmasking the issues in Android applications and internals.

</ul>
