<h3 id="1importanceoflearningdevelopment">1) <strong>Importance of learning development</strong>:</h3>

<p>Before starting to focus on web security, learn to develop a web application from scratch using one of the development languages. This will really help you along your way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A person who knows how to develop things from ground can learn to break things effectively !</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Learn any of the development frameworks (I used to learn in PHP but it’s outdated now). You can use any of the following below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Django </li>

<li>Ruby on Rails</li>

<li>NodeJs</li>

<li>PHP</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several others but I <strong>strongly</strong> suggest you start with one of the above. Learn it properly, how to develop complicated apps from ground using one of the above frameworks. The app should be a sort of an e-commerce platform. For the front end, there are several templates available online which you can reuse. Don’t waste too much time on front-end rather focus on the functionalities and back-end. 
<br />
<br />
The Web application should have the following functionalities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Login page using PostgreSQL/MySQL in back end</li>

<li>Products should be displayed in home page


<ul>
<li>Title,  where name should be displayed</li>

<li>Description if possible</li>

<li>Button for adding into cart</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Interactive page using JQuery and JavaScript (to buy products)


<ul>
<li>User should be able to add products to the cart</li>

<li>Delete items from the cart</li>

<li>Checkout page</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Profile page to  display the details of the user</li>

<li>A logout button</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you a lot.
<br /></p>

<h3 id="2letsgettosecurity">2) Let’s get to security !</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I am assuming that you have very basic understanding of PHP/MySQL and JavaScript. Rest can be learned when you go through the syllabus: (I suggest you learn in the following order, complete 1 and go to 2.. )

</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="3howtoapproachaproblem">3) How to approach a problem:</h3>

<p>There is a methodology is testing/recon a web challenge which can easily be automated in python. I have already written a script for this but I am not sharing it because I want all of you to write your own scripts for the same. Here are the steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Look into the common places of interesting information. Some good places to check are:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML source code</li>

<li>Robots.txt</li>

<li>HTTP response headers</li>

<li>Cookies</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Analyse these details to find out anything interesting is there. Most of the times, you will get interesting things out of these. Is there a hint in the source ? Is the application hiding some sensitive directories from search engines in robots.txt ? If cookies are encoded (base64 ?) then try decoding to find any juicy stuffs out.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Before trying to exploit, see what the challenge is doing and understand it. Ask yourself these questions about the challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any login/Register functionality ? Can we register a new account and login ? See what all functionalities can we do after logging in. Is there a password reset ?  Can we send message to admins/other users ?
<br /><br /></li>

<li>What is the main functionality of the challenge ? What is it trying to do ? In most cases, we need to abuse/exploit the main functionality to get flag.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you get answers for all the above questions, now you know precisely how the application works. Now let’s try to exploit it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Identify all the places of userinput (login/register/password reset pages ?) <br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p>Identify all GET/POST parameters which we can control. Identify the context of user inputs and parameters.<br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p>Try exploiting it according to the context. </p>

<ul>
<li>For ex: a login page, most probably, there will be a database behind which fetches the username/pass. So if  vulnerability exist, it would most often be database exploitation or in other words sql injections !
<br /><br /></li>

<li>If it is a message sending functionality, most probably the message you send will be read by another user or an admin right ? So what if we can include javascript statements in our message which might get triggered when admins/users read the message ? or in other words, the possibility of an XSS is high here.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Similarly understand all functionalities + contexts and see which vulnerability can occur with most probability. Your calculations will become more accurate when you solve more problems !</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not blindly test applications without following the above steps. Learn and continue your each steps. Fuzzing with random payloads is not the way to play CTF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="4otherveryimportantthingstodo">4) Other very important things to do:</h3>

<p>Technical skills are not the only important skill that you should have. Socialising with <strong>Good</strong> security researchers is very essentials for your growth. Other fellow researchers should know that you are also a passionate security guy who works hard. This will help you in getting good jobs, recognition etc. Make sure you follow whatever I said below which will help you get more publicity in the security community.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Twitter account:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure you have a Twitter account. Most of the security researchers hangs around in twitter. Eg: Look at my twitter profile: <a href="https://twitter.com/a0xnirudh">a0xnirudh</a>
<br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p>Tweets should look good with valid hashtags + precise details. Use URL shortners like goo.gl to shorten big urls before sharing. Eg: <a href="https://twitter.com/0daylabs">0daylabs</a> - My blog twitter account.<br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p>Retweet others tweet only if you believe it’s highly relevant. Don’t retweet simply without any logic !<br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/a0xnirudh/lists/security-bugbounty-ctf">Security-Bugbounty-CTFs</a>: A twitter list that I am maintaining which contains the best security researchers who regularly tweets. Make sure you follow this list <strong>everyday</strong>. I repeat, everyday ! Keep this as your routine.</p></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Personal Website: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a good personal website in wordpress/github pages (I recommend github pages). You can learn about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">publishing a github page</a>. <a href="http://jekyllthemes.io/theme/14398159/dbyll">Dbyll</a> and <a href="http://jekyllthemes.io/theme/8068127/hyde">Hyde</a> is a very good personal jekyll themes to use.<br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p>Managing a blog on your github will increase the number of contributions on your github profile too.<br /><br /></p></li>

<li><p>Write technical contents only. No personal bullshits ! If you want to have write daily routine stuffs, create another blog (Why should others read your personal day to day things in the first place ? )<br /><br /></p></li>


<li><p>The main things you can write in your blog which the security community reads will be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CTF writeups</strong> (Very important)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Bug Bounty writeups</strong> (only quality bugs, no simple stuff that an automated scanner can find)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Paper critiques</strong> (Read quality papers and put a write up)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Tutorials</strong> (especially on hard to understand topics)</p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>When you are writing articles/writeups, make sure its clear and crisp. People should understand:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How you <strong>approach</strong> the problem. What are the initial recon steps</p></li>

<li><p>How did you <strong>identified</strong> the vulnerability ? What was the payload you used ?</p></li>

<li><p>How did you <strong>exploit</strong> it ? Detailed step by step with code blocks and images.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li><p>Give/Attend talks in conferences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Attend conferences like c0c0n, Nullcon, GroundZero every year. If possible try to give a talk in any of the above conferences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://is-ra.org/c0c0n/">c0c0n</a> CFP opens usually in March/April and happens in August.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://nullcon.net/website/">Nullcon</a> CFP opens in November/December and happens in Feb (next year)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.g0s.org/">Groundzero</a> CFP opens in July/August and happens in November.. This sometimes happens in colombo too.</p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>Try to attend all the above 3 conference every year. The best way is to apply for CFP and if you get selected, they will sponsor you. Conferences like Nullcon will give you a VIP pass if you just apply for CFP (even if it you get rejected)</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>Primary Objective</strong> of attending these conferences is to get contacts of as many security researchers as possible. This would really help you in future ! If you don’t plan on socialising with others, never mind going to any of the conferences above. It’s useless !</p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>IRC:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>IRC is yet another good place where researchers hang around. There are some good channels in freenode which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>##security</li>

<li>#vulnhub</li>

<li>#styprchall</li></ul></li>

<li><p>Some really awesome channels are there in <code>irc.smashthestack.org</code> which is highly recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li>#websec (some really awesome people here) </li></ul></li>

<li><p>Hang around, if possible help others, listen to what kind of question others ask and how they reply etc.</p></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open source Tools</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write automation scripts which can make life easier for both you and others. Make it open source so that others can use and contribute to it as well. </p></li>

<li><p>Try contributing to other good tools out there. OWASP tools is a great starting point but there are lot more !</p></li></ul></li>
